#CREATEHUB DATABASE

I made this database for a project in bootcamp. The project was intended to be a social networking and commerce application where people who have real world crafting skills can advertise the things they have made, as well as hire others or be hired by others to do small parts of other projects. 
It uses a total of twelve relational tables, including many-to-many joins. This database keeps track of several types of data items:

* users

* skills

* projects

* jobs

* bids

The database is built so that you can find any of the datasets from any table.
